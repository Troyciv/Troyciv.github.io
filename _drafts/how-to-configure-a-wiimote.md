title: How to configure a Wiimote controller for an N64 emulator
---

I recently wanted to shoot up an old n64 game on an emulator again and ran into some problems when trying to set up my wiimote controller.

This is how I solved it.

### Installation

Of course we need to install some packages first.

There are two very popular N64 emulators out there, Mupen64plus and Project64.

```bash
apt install 
```

We also need to install bluetooth and the drivers for the wiimote.

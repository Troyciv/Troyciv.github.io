In my [last post]() I explained the whole card creation process in principle.
Now that you have a deck with a bunch of cards it's time to review them.
But not all cards are handled similarly in Anki.
I will explain the differences between new cards, young cards, and mature cards.
As well as lapsed, suspended and marked cards.
Anki knows different states for each card
unseen, new , mature, lapsed, buried, marked and suspended cards
